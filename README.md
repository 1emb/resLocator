# resLocator
We use "https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/google-maps-nearby-search-js/#0" as a guild to write our index.html file
# how to start the server:
We need to use SSH to connect to the public DNS: ec2-3-131-208-180.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com (it requires a public key which Minh has).
From there, we go in to resLocator/app/ and start the server using: 
  node server.js
